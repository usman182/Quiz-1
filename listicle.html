          <p class="bodyParagraphs">When's the last time you've had an Italian soda? It had been a
            while for me, but I wanted to join my friend<br> for a non-caffeinated
            beverage at Bytes and I became reaquainted with the combination of
            fizzy water and<br> artificial fruit syrup. Italian sodas are not so
            sweet as a normal soda and not so boring as a flavored<br> carbonated
            water. The Italian sodas at Bytes also have no cream in them
            (or maybe they do if you ask; I<br> haven't tried), which makes
            it a nice coffee shop alternative for the times when you're
            feeling a refreshing<br> drink that doesn't have caffeine or milk.

          <p class="bodyParagraphs">When your boba craving strikes, head over to Pop Tea Bar, a cute little bubble tea shop on Cambridge<br> Avenue. The menu is your standard bubble tea fare with nothing too adventurous on the menu -- no<br> bubble tea floats, for example -- but the tapioca is fresh, the service is fast, and the tea is smooth and<br> delicious! They have little bites to eat too, like popcorn chicken and eggrolls, in perfect snack-size portions.<br> There's not too much seating, but there's a cute outdoor area in the back for warmer days.<br>

            Pop Tea Bar isn't exactly on campus, but the Marguerite has got you covered. Ride the 1050A to California<br> and El Camino and it's a short walk from there. (11 minutes total from the Gates Computer Science<br> Building!)

            I can't tell you whether CoHo has a particularly amazing Vanilla Bean Latte, only because CoHo is the only<br> place I've ever ordered a Vanilla Bean Latte from. I'm not even totally sure I know what a Vanilla Bean Latte<br> is supposed to taste like. What I do know is the Vanilla Bean Latte I ordered on a whim from CoHo was<br> delicious.

            Nexus Cafe has a lot of tasty things packed into its cafeteria space, including agua fresca! Grab a cup of this<br> fresh and fruity beverage before you head to the check out line. Nexus Cafe has plenty of indoor and<br> outdoor seating, too, so on the next sunny day, take a break on the patio with a cup of agua fresca, and<br> maybe a burrito.
